The pyzeta set of script is a Python implementation of Craig's Zeta and related measures.
Zeta is a measure of keyness or distinctiveness for contrastive analysis of two groups of texts.
This set of scripts does preprocessing, data preparation, score calculation, and visualization.
See the readme.md and howto.md files for help on how to run the script.

This module performs several steps in preparing the data for analysis.
First, it splits each text into segments of a given length.
Second, it either takes all segments or samples an equal number of segments per text.
Third, it selects the desired features from each segment (form and pos)
Fourth, it creates document-term matrixes with absolute, relative and binary feature counts.
This function needs to be run again when a parameter is changed.
